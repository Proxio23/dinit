Meson build system for Dinit
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

<!> Special notes about building Dinit via Meson
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Please keep in mind:
1. Meson build system for Dinit is experimental way to build Dinit. 
   so maybe its have some bugs. Please report bugs to https://github.com/davmac314/dinit/issues
2. Meson build system for Dinit is "extra" part. The main build system is GNU make.
   This means that the feature is first tested on make. There may also be delays in adding new Dinit's features to Meson builds. 
3. If you see some bugs in Meson builds. Please also test it on GNU make builds.

Buidling Dinit via Meson
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Buidling Dinit is avaiable via two "Build system": meson & make.
Its file tell everything you need to buidling Dinit via meson.
Bulding dinit via meson requires "meson" and a C++11 compiler (GCC version 4.9 and later, or Clang ~5.0 and later, should be fine)

Meson configure all you need to build Dinit. Its detect your OS, detect your compiler & set something based on your system information.
By Default no action required & meson configure everything needed to build Dinit.

in Meson you need to prepare "Buidling Dir". simply just type:

    meson setup builddir/

This command configure "Building dir" to compile Dinit. If everything goes smoothly this will prepare everything to build dinit, dinitctl, and optionaly the shutdown/reboot/halt utilitys by default.

Finaly you can compile Dinit with changing current directory to builddir/ & run:

     meson compile

Note: on old Mesons you must use "ninja compile" instead of "meson compile".
This command build the dinit, dinitctl, and optionaly the shutdown/reboot/halt utilitys by default.
